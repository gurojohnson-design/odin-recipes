# odin-recipes

Intro
    This project aims to teach me how to set up a basic html recipe website. It allegedly won't look pretty but it will function and we will be coming back to it later to work on css and js. I wasn't really given any guidelines for what to put in the intro other than I would be coming back to this later for reference on some ptoential growth. 

    We will see


Brother
    Need to label all the elements for css. 
    Outline css with tags and decide what the format is.
